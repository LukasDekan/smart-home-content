        <h2>How Smarthouse was built</h2>
        <p>This house was made possible thanks to the work of over 200 people.</p>
        <p>As a way to plan the house and desing it's exterior, the Smarthouse went through a 4-step art development process in it's pre-production stage.</p>
        <p>5 concept artist worked together to develop what this house would look like:</p>

        <p>When they finished, their work was then transferred to the 3D modelling team consisting of 67 people, who all contributed to the final desing of the Smarthouse.</p>

        <p>Finally, the interior desing team <br>
           (a total of 156 people, including our own electrical team and our delivery and furniture assembly teams)</br>
           <br>worked on placing all of the high-tech furniture featured in the Smarthouse as well as connecting</br>
           <br>wires and doing all the electrical work.</br>
