            <p>Relax... this home has it all, including the most high-tech safety features on the planet. Here's a walkthrough of all the safety technology of the Smarthouse.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>Anti-fire Snakes</h2>
        <p>The anti-fire snakes are special robot machines that put out fires whenever the Fire alarm goes off.</p>

        <h2>Safety hazard robots</h2>
        <p>The anti-fire snakes are similar to the Safety hazard robots, which are sent in case the Anti-fire Snakes can't handle a fire in Smarthouse.</p>

        <h2>Water Rats</h2>
        <p>These robots put out little fires anywhere in or outside of Smarthouse.</p>

        <h2>Indoor sprinklers</h2>
        <p>The indoor sprinklers put out very small fires.</p>

        <h2>Shudder feature</h2>
        <p>Another home security feature of Smarthouse is the shudder feature.</p>
        <p>The Smarthouse automatically shudders when no one is inside<br>if the Smarthouse detecs suspicious movement happening right outside of it.</br></p>
